# Simple Tamagotchi and Telegram Tamagotchi Bot with MySQL

This README covers two distinct projects that I've developed using Python and MySQL: a Simple Tamagotchi implementation and a Telegram Tamagotchi Bot implementation. These projects involve creating virtual pet experiences, each with their unique characteristics

### Simple Tamagotchi

The Simple Tamagotchi project is a straightforward console-based game written in Python. It enables users to interact with a virtual pet by feeding, playing, and keeping an eye on its status. I utilized a MySQL database to persistently store pet data

### Telegram Tamagotchi Bot

The Telegram Tamagotchi Bot project takes the Tamagotchi experience to the Telegram platform. This bot allows users to interact with their virtual pet directly within the Telegram app. The pet can be cared for through specific bot commands.
